## Welcome Page

Once you run the program, you would be greeted with this interface:

```
{WORDS TO VOCABULARY LIST}
By: Ben Choy

This program can accept a plain text (.txt) file, automatically
look up all the words in it, and generate a Markdown (.md) file
containing meaning, Chinese translation, synonyms, and antonyms
(if available) of each word. It also supports creation of plain
text file for importing to Anki.

===============================================================

{MAIN MENU}

Enter keyword to select one of the following options:
[C] Generate vocab list from text file
[D] Convert the outputted Markdown file to Word Document
[exit] Quit program

>
```

To interact with the program, you can enter a text command after the `>` symbol. Instruction is available on the screen, and keywords (a.k.a. commands) are encapsulated by `[ ]` symbol. You only need to enter the word inside the symbol. Keywords are **case-sensitive**.

> For "Yes/No" prompt, entering anything but `Y` would be considered "No".

Enter one of the commands available below and hit `[Enter]` on your keyboard to proceed.

- `C` : Start creating vocabulary list from text file.
- `D` : Convert the Markdown file generated by the program to Word Document
- `exit` : Quit the program. The program would be terminated immediately.

#### Troubleshooting

***Invalid Command***

```
<Error> Invalid command!
```

**Possible reason:** Typo appears in the command, or a non-existing command is entered.

**Solution:** Make sure you enter the correct command. Remember: commands are case-sensitive!

## Generate Vocabulary List from Text File

### 1. Enter the File Path

```
===============================================================

{GENERATE VOCAB LIST FROM TEXT FILE}

In the plain text file, words should be separated by space or
line breaks ONLY.
Enter the file path for the text file:

>
```

Once you enter this interface, you will be prompted to enter the *file path* of the text file that contains all the English words you want to be converted.

> A **file path** of a file is a text that represents the location of the file on a computer. An example of a file path in Microsoft Windows is as below:
>
> `C:\Users\Public\Documents\demo.txt`
>
> It represents the file `demo.txt` that is in the "Documents" folder, that is in the "Public" folder, that is in the "Users" folder on C Drive.

Enter the file path of the text file to proceed. On Microsoft Windows, you can also drag the text file to the Command Prompt window, and the file path of the file would be entered automatically.

> It is highly recommended that the text file should contain words **separated by space or line breaks ONLY**. Only the Standard Version of the program can remove punctuation during the normalization process.

If the file path is correct, the program would start reading the text file.

```
Loading word list... Found 10 word(s)!
```

The program would normalize the words (only available in Standard Version) and store a list of *unique* words extracted from the text file (i.e., no words with the exact spelling would appear twice in the list). The word list would also be sorted in alphabetical order. The number of *unique* words found in the text file would be shown on the screen.

> During the normalization process, words would be reduced to their base form (no tenses, no plural forms, etc.), and punctuation would be removed.

#### Troubleshooting

***File Input Error***

```
<Error> File input error!
Do you want to try again?
[Y] Yes     [N] No
```

**Possible reason:** You entered an incorrect file path that does not link to any file.

**Solution:** If you want to try again, enter `Y` and enter the file path again. If you would like to give up, enter `N` instead.

### 2. Output Options

#### Markdown file

You would be asked whether you would like to create a Markdown file containing word meanings, Chinese translation, synonyms, and antonyms or each word in the word list.

```
Do you want to create a Markdown file for word meanings,
synonyms, and antonyms?
[Y] Yes     [N] No
```

If you enter `Y` , such file would be created.

#### Anki flashcard

> [**Anki**](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a program that allows users to create flashcards for studying. The user would first see the front of each "flashcard," then they can reveal the back of the "flashcard" to check the answers.
>
> This program would generate a text file that can be imported to Anki to create flashcards.

You would be asked whether you would like to create a plain text file that can be imported to Anki for creating studying flashcards.

```
Do you want to create a plain text file for importing to Anki?
[Y] Yes     [N] No
```

If you enter `Y` , such file would be created. Note that once you choose to create the file, further prompt would be made:

```
Select mode for plain text file output:
[1] English Word - English Meaning
[2] English Word - Chinese Translation
[3] English Word - English Meaning & Chinese Translation
```

You would be asked to choose one of the three output modes for the Anki flashcards. Choosing different modes would result in different outputs:

1. The front of the card would be the English word, and the back of the card would be its English meaning only.
2. The front of the card would be the English word, and the back of the card would be its Chinese translation only.
3. The front of the card would be the English word, and the back of the card would be both its English meaning and its Chinese translation.

Enter the corresponding number for the mode you want to proceed.

#### Troubleshooting

***Invalid Input***

```
<Error> Invalid input! Please input [1], [2] or [3] only.
```

**Possible reason:** You entered a number/word that does not correspond to any mode.

**Solution:** You would be prompted to enter your choice again. Please enter the correct number to choose the mode you want.

***No File Type is Selected for Export***

```
<Error> No file type is selected for export.
```

**Possible reason:** You choose "No" for outputting both file types.

**Solution:** The program would return to the main menu. You may start the conversion procedure again.

### 3. Looking Up the Words

After configuring the program's output, the program will start looking up the words from different sources and generating the files. This process would take a while, so please wait patiently.

```
██                         Looking up (1 of 10)
```

After the program finishes the process, `File creation completed! File saved as [...]` would be shown (actual message depends on which file you choose to output)

> The files created would be saved in the same folder as the program. The file name for the Markdown file and text file created is `Output.md` and `Output.txt` , respectively.
>
> Also, if you have created `Output.md` and `Output.txt` before and the files are still in the same folder as the program, the program would overwrite them while creating a new vocabulary list. Make sure you move the files to another location / rename them if you want to keep the previous files.

The program then returns to the main menu.

#### Troubleshooting

***The Program Get Stuck on Looking Up a Particular Word***

```
█████████████████          Looking up (6 of 9)
```

**Possible reason:** Internet connection problem.

**Solution:** Make sure your computer is connected to the internet and try again.

***Words Cannot be Looked Up***

```
4 word(s) cannot be looked up! Do you want to check out?
[Y] Yes     [N] No
```

When you see this prompt, you may enter `Y` to see the list of words that cannot be looked up, or `N` if you choose not to see it.

**Possible reason 1:** Internet connection problem

**Solution:** Make sure your computer is connected to the internet and try again.

**Possible reason 2:** The word does not appear in the English dictionary.

**Solution:** There's nothing that the program can do for this reason. You may look up the word from other sources.

## Convert Outputted Markdown File to Word Document

You can convert the Markdown file to Word Document (.docx) for your convenience.

> Note that [**pandoc**](https://pandoc.org/) must be installed on your computer to use this feature. You may refer to the installation guide from [here](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).

From the Main Menu, enter `D` to use this feature. The file conversion would be started immediately.

```
{MAIN MENU}

Enter keyword to select one of the following options:
[C] Generate vocab list from text file
[D] Convert the outputted Markdown file to Word Document
[exit] Quit program

>
```

Once the file conversion process is finished, a success message will be shown on the screen.

```
Convertion success! File saved as [Output.docx]
```

> If you have created `Output.docx` before and the file is still in the same folder as the program, the file would be overwritten while the program converts a new Markdown file. Make sure you move the file to another location / rename them if you want to keep the previous file.

#### Troubleshooting

***Output.md Not Found***

```
<Error> [Output.md] not found!
```

**Possible reason:** You haven't created the Markdown file using the program, or the file has been renamed / moved to other locations / deleted.

**Solution:** You may create the Markdown file again using the program and try again.

***Pandoc is not Recognized as an Command***

```
'pandoc' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

**Possible reason:** Pandoc is not installed on your computer.

**Solution:** Install pandoc from the official [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) website.
